This project does not include any Authentication and Authorization models, but it presents:
<ul>
  <li>How to manage entity relationships between entities using Django models</li>
  <li>How to view data from the database</li>
  <li>How to accept data from users</li>
  <li>How to handle forms for user registration</li>
</ul>
